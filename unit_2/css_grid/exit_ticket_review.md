# Review

* Flexbox vs Grid
* Overflow on `grid-auto-rows`. Auto. `minmax`
* Grid item placing. Starts at 1

# Flexbox
* `justify-content` - alignment along the main axis
* `align-items` - behavior along the cross axis
* `flex-direction` - define the main axis
* Using Flexbox means that we automatically have responsive UIs on mobile browsers without adding any additional code.
