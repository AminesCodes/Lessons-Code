# Pursuit Core Web 6.2 Lessons' Code

This repository contains the JavaScript programs and code snippets written by [Alejo](https://github.com/alejo4373) and students during lessons.

The purpose of this repository is to share the code written during lesson with the class so that access, review and study of it is possible. Also so that Alejo doesn't have to be sharing code snippets on Slack (which sucks).

This repo is organized by units and lessons. Every unit is a top level folder with sub-folders for every lesson.

## Directory Structure
```
  .
  ├── unit_1
  │   └── ...
  ├── unit_2
  │   └── ...
  └── unit_3
      ├── express_middleware
      ├── intro_to_express
      ├── node_and_event_loop
      ├── npm_and_modules
      └── passing_data_express
```

## Special Instructions
If the code you want to review is in a folder that contains a `package.json` file like `unit_3/express_middleware` you will need to execute `npm install` while being in that directory. This command will download all the packages listed under the `dependencies` property of the json document. That is it will download from npm all the dependencies the code needs to work.

Uploading dependencies to GitHub is discouraged because they occupy considerable space and often get updated. That is the reason behind this.
