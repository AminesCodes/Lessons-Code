-- Briahana's
DELETE FROM likes 
  WHERE liker_id = 1 AND post_id = (

      WHERE poster_id = 2
  )
;

-- Alejo's 1st Approach.
-- DELETE FROM likes WHERE post_id = 4 AND liker_id = 1;

-- Alejo's 2nd Approach.
-- DELETE
-- FROM likes tl 
-- USING posts tp
-- WHERE tl.liker_id = 1 AND tp.poster_id = 2;


---------
-- The user who had three posts decides to delete his/her last post.
---------

-- Sharrar's Approach
-- DELETE FROM likes
-- WHERE post_id = 4; -- deletes likes on their posts

-- DELETE FROM posts
-- WHERE poster_id = 2; -- deletes their posts

-- Alejo's Approach. Taking advantage of ON DELETE CASCADE
DELETE FROM posts WHERE poster_id = 1 AND body = 'Somebody stole my dragons'; 

---------
-- User 2 decides to delete their account from of social media app.
---------

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;

-----------
-- Find the user who has given the most likes.
-----------

-- Douglas' Approach

SELECT * FROM users

    SELECT liker_id

      GROUP BY liker_id
      ORDER BY COUNT(liker_id) DESC

\echo =========================

-- Sergio's Approach
SELECT name, COUNT(post_id) AS num_of_likes
  FROM users
  JOIN likes ON users.id = likes.liker_id
  GROUP BY name
  ORDER BY num_of_likes DESC
  LIMIT 1
  ;



-- Alejo's Approach
SELECT count(likes.id) AS likes_given, users.name FROM likes
  JOIN users ON liker_id = users.id
  GROUP BY (users.name)
  ORDER BY likes_given DESC
  LIMIT 1
;

-- 2nd Approach
-- Finding the most liked post first and 
-- then nested select to grab the user by liker_id

-- Stage 1.
-- SELECT COUNT(likes.id) AS times_liked, liker_id FROM likes
--  GROUP BY liker_id
--  ORDER BY times_liked DESC; 

-- Stage 2.
-- SELECT liker_id FROM likes
--  GROUP BY liker_id
--  ORDER BY COUNT(likes.id) DESC
--  LIMIT 1;

-- Stage 3. Final, nesting
SELECT * from users
  WHERE id = (
    SELECT liker_id FROM likes
      GROUP BY liker_id
      ORDER BY COUNT(likes.id) DESC
      LIMIT 1
  );
